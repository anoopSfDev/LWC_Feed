Companies that asked this: Salesforce, Oracle, IBM, Microsoft, Adobe

Answer:
Properties pass data values that child components process and display, while slots pass pre-built markup/UI content that gets inserted into specific locations.

Key Differences:

| Properties                            | Slots                               |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Pass **data values**                  | Pass **markup/components**          |
| Child **controls rendering**          | Parent **controls content**         |
| **Reactive** to data changes          | **Static** markup insertion         |
| **Type-safe** (primitives preferred)  | **Flexible** (any markup)           |


When to Use Properties:

Passing primitive data (strings, numbers, booleans)

Child component needs to process or transform the data

Data-driven components (tables, forms, charts)

When you want reactive updates based on data changes

When to Use Slots:

Passing complex UI components or markup

Parent wants full control over content structure

Building layout/container components

When content structure is variable or complex

Composition-based designs
