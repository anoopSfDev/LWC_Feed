Answer:
An LWC component bundle consists of several files, and each has a specific purpose. The key thing to understand is that you can have multiple JavaScript files in a single component bundle for better code organization.

Required Files:

1. Main JavaScript File (.js) - This is the brain of the component

Must have the same name as the component folder

Contains the component class that extends LightningElement

Handles data binding, properties, and main component logic

2. HTML Template (.html) - This is the face of the component

Must have the same name as the component folder

Defines the structure and layout

Uses data binding to display dynamic content

3. Configuration File (.js-meta.xml) - This is the metadata

Must have the same name as the component folder

Tells Salesforce where and how the component can be used

Defines API version, targets, and properties

Optional Files:

4. CSS File (.css) - Component styling

Component-specific styles that are encapsulated

Cannot affect other components due to Shadow DOM

5. Additional JavaScript Files - For code organization

helper.js, utils.js, constants.js, validators.js, etc.

Can contain utility functions, constants, or helper classes

Must be imported into the main component file

6. SVG File (.svg) - Custom icon for Lightning App Builder


Interview Tips:

Emphasize modularity: Multiple JS files help organize complex components

Mention naming convention: Main component file must match folder name exactly

Explain imports: Additional JS files must be imported using relative paths

Note file limits: While you can have multiple JS files, keep bundles reasonable in size

Show best practices: Separate concerns (validators, helpers, constants) into different files
