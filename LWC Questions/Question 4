Answer:
Shadow DOM is a web standard that provides encapsulation for DOM elements and CSS styles. Think of it like a private container where your component's HTML and CSS live separately from the main document.

Benefits of Shadow DOM:

Style Isolation: CSS in one component doesn't affect others

DOM Encapsulation: Internal structure is hidden from outside

No Global CSS Conflicts: Prevents style bleeding

How LWC Uses Shadow DOM:
When you create an LWC component, Salesforce automatically creates a Shadow DOM tree for it. This means your component's styles and DOM structure are completely isolated.

Example:

/* myComponent.css */
.title {
    color: red;
    font-size: 24px;
}
 
.container {
    background: yellow;
    padding: 20px;
}
<!-- myComponent.html -->
<template>
    <div class="container">
        <h1 class="title">My Component Title</h1>
        <p>This content is in Shadow DOM</p>
    </div>
</template>
Other Component:

css
/* anotherComponent.css */
.title {
    color: blue;  /* This won't affect myComponent's .title */
    font-size: 12px;
}
Real-World Example:

In my last project, I had two components on the same page - a header component and a card component. Both had a .title class, but because of Shadow DOM encapsulation:

Header component's .title was blue and 18px

Card component's .title was red and 14px

They didn't interfere with each other

Accessing Shadow DOM Elements:

export default class MyComponent extends LightningElement {
    renderedCallback() {
        // Access elements within this component's Shadow DOM
        const titleElement = this.template.querySelector('.title');
        console.log(titleElement); // Works - element is in this shadow tree
        
        // Cannot access elements from other components
        const outsideElement = document.querySelector('.other-component-title');
        console.log(outsideElement); // null - not in this shadow tree
    }
}
Interview Tips:

Explain with a real-world analogy (like apartments in a building)

Mention that this.template.querySelector() only searches within the component

Emphasize how this prevents CSS conflicts in large applications

Note that global styles still apply (like SLDS utilities)
