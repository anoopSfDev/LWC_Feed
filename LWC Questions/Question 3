Companies that asked this: Salesforce, Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, PWC

Answer:
There are several key benefits of LWC over Aura, and I'll break them down into performance and development advantages:

Performance Benefits:

1. Faster Loading: LWC components load 2-3x faster than Aura

Native browser APIs instead of custom framework

Smaller bundle sizes (LWC: ~15KB vs Aura: ~50KB)

2. Better Runtime Performance:

No overhead from Aura's custom rendering engine

Direct DOM manipulation using web standards

3. Memory Efficiency:

Less memory consumption due to lighter framework

Better garbage collection



Development Benefits:

1. Easier Learning Curve:

Uses standard JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS

No need to learn Aura-specific syntax like {!v.attribute}

2. Better Developer Tools:

Standard browser DevTools work perfectly

Better debugging experience

IntelliSense support in VS Code

3. Future-Proof:

Based on web standards that evolve with the web

Salesforce's strategic direction moving forward



Real Project Experience:

In my previous project, we migrated a dashboard from Aura to LWC:

Before (Aura):

15 seconds initial load time

200KB total bundle size

3 developers needed 2 weeks to understand codebase

After (LWC):

5 seconds initial load time

80KB total bundle size

New developers with JS background understood it in 2-3 days



Interview Tips:

Always provide specific numbers when possible (load times, bundle sizes)

Mention real project experiences if you have them

Emphasize that Salesforce is investing in LWC, not Aura

Note that existing Aura components still work, but new development should use LWC

Mention better mobile performance with LWC



⚠️ Important Notes:

Don't say Aura is "bad" - it was great for its time

Acknowledge that some complex scenarios might still require Aura temporarily

Show that you understand migration strategies

Mention that Lightning App Builder works with both frameworks



Follow-up Questions You Might Get:

"When would you still use Aura?"

Answer: For existing complex components that would be expensive to rewrite immediately

"How do you handle Aura-to-LWC migration?"

Answer: Gradual migration, starting with simpler components, maintaining APIs for compatibility
