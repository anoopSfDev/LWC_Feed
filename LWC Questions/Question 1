Answer:
Lightning Web Components is Salesforce's modern UI framework that was introduced in 2019. It's built on web standards like Custom Elements, Shadow DOM, and ES6+ JavaScript.

Let me explain the key differences from Aura Components:

Performance: LWC is much faster because it uses native browser APIs instead of the custom framework that Aura uses. For example, when I worked on a data table component, the LWC version loaded 40% faster than the Aura equivalent.

Bundle Size: LWC components are smaller. An Aura component might be 50KB, while the same LWC component could be just 15KB.

Learning Curve: If you know modern JavaScript and HTML, LWC is easier to learn. Aura has its own syntax like {!v.attribute}, while LWC uses standard JavaScript.

Browser Support: LWC works on all modern browsers without needing additional polyfills.



Example:

Js

export default class HelloWorld extends LightningElement {
    @api greeting = 'Hello';
    
    get message() {
        return `${this.greeting}, World!`;
    }
}
html

<template>
    <p>{message}</p>
</template>
VS

javascript
// Aura Component (Legacy)
({
    doInit: function(component, event, helper) {
        component.set("v.greeting", "Hello");
    }
})


Interview Tips:

Always mention performance benefits first

Give a real project example if possible

Don't just list differences, explain WHY LWC is better

Mention that Salesforce is moving towards LWC
