Answer:
disconnectedCallback is called when a component is removed from the DOM. It's crucial for cleanup operations to prevent memory leaks, performance issues, and unexpected behavior.

Primary Uses:

Remove event listeners - Prevent memory leaks

Cancel ongoing operations - Abort API calls, clear timers

Cleanup third-party libraries - Destroy charts, maps, plugins

Unsubscribe from services - Platform events, message channels

Clear references - Remove object references to help garbage collection


Real-World Use Cases:

Remove Event Listeners

window.removeEventListener('resize', this.handleResize);
✅ Use case: You added a global event (e.g., for responsive layout) in connectedCallback().

Cancel Ongoing Operations

clearTimeout(this.timerId);
✅ Use case: You started a timer, and it needs to be aborted to save network resources.

Destroy Third-party Libraries

if (this.chart){ this.chart.destroy();}
✅ Use case: You rendered a chart (Chart.js or D3) — it needs cleanup to prevent DOM pollution.

Unsubscribe from Services

this.subscription = null;
unsubscribe(this.messageContext, this.subscription);
✅ Use case: Unsubscribing from Lightning Message Service or Platform Events.

Clear Object References

this.largeDataObject = null;
✅ Use case: Release large memory objects to help garbage collection.
