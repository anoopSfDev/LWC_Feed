Asked by: Salesforce, TCS, Infosys, Cognizant

Answer:
The render() method and lwc:if/if:true are both used to conditionally render content in Lightning Web Components, but they serve different purposes and are best used in different scenarios.

Aspect => Use Case
render() Method => Completely different layouts
lwc:if / if:true => Show/hide elements

Aspect => Templates
render() Method => Multiple template files
lwc:if / if:true => Single template

Aspect => Performance
render() Method => Loads only needed template
lwc:if / if:true => All elements in DOM

Aspect => Complexity
render() Method => Good for complex differences
lwc:if / if:true => Good for simple conditions

Aspect => Maintenance
render() Method => Separate files to maintain
lwc:if / if:true => Single template file
