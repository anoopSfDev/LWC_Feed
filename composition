Answer:
In Lightning Web Components (LWC), component composition refers to the practice of combining smaller, reusable components to build more complex UIs. This is typically done by embedding child components inside a parent component’s HTML template.

Example of Composition:

Let’s say we have a child component named c-contact-card that displays a contact’s details.
In the parent component's HTML:

<template>
  <c-contact-card contact={contact}></c-contact-card>
</template>
Here, contact is a property passed from the parent to the child via a public property marked with @api in the child component's JavaScript.

Benefits of Component Composition:

Reusability: Small components can be reused across different parts of the app, reducing redundancy.

Separation of Concerns: Logic and UI are separated into different, focused components.

Maintainability: Changes in one component do not impact others if the interface remains consistent.

Improved Testing: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation.

Encapsulation: Each component manages its own state and behavior, leading to more predictable outcomes.

Interview Tips:

Be prepared to explain how data flows from parent to child (@api) and how to use custom events for child-to-parent communication.

Mention real scenarios where you split a large component into smaller, reusable pieces.

If asked, discuss performance benefits due to LWC's shadow DOM and rendering optimization when composing components.
