Answer:
Lightning Data Service (LDS) enables you to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in Lightning Web Components without writing Apex code. LDS respects field-level security (FLS), object-level CRUD permissions, and sharing rules, ensuring secure and compliant data access.

CRUD Operations in LWC using LDS:

Create Record – Use the createRecord() function from lightning/uiRecordApi.

Read Record – Use the getRecord wire adapter from lightning/uiRecordApi.

Update Record – Use the updateRecord() function.

Delete Record – Use the deleteRecord() function.



Advantages of Using LDS in LWC:

No need to write Apex for basic CRUD.

Built-in support for:

FLS (Field-Level Security)

Sharing rules

CRUD permissions

LDS automatically handles cache and performance optimizations.

Better user experience with less boilerplate code.
