Answer:
Lightning Data Service provides three main approaches to perform operations on data and access metadata in Lightning Web Components:

1. Base Components (Recommended for Forms)

Components:

lightning-record-form: For quickly creating, viewing, or editing records with automatic layout and mode detection.

lightning-record-edit-form: For editing records with custom field selection and layout.

lightning-record-view-form: For displaying records in a read-only format.

When to Use:

Rapid form development with minimal custom logic.

Standard CRUD operations where Salesforce handles layout, validation, and error handling.

Scenarios where you want built-in field-level security and automatic UI update

2. Wire Adapters and Functions (lightning/ui*Api modules)

Key Wire Adapters:

getRecord - Retrieve single record

getRecords - Retrieve multiple records

getObjectInfo - Object metadata

getPicklistValues: Fetch picklist values for a specific field.

getRelatedListRecords: Retrieve records from a related list of a parent record.

Functions: Programmatic record manipulation.

createRecord - Create new records

updateRecord - Update existing records

deleteRecord - Delete records

When to Use:

Custom UI or business logic is required.

Need to process or transform data before display.

Fine-grained control over which fields or records are accessed.

Implementing custom validation or complex workflows

3. GraphQL API Wire Adapter

Purpose:

Modern query language for flexible data fetching

Single request for complex, related data

Reduced over-fetching of unnecessary data

When to Use:

Fetching complex, related datasets across multiple objects.

Reducing over-fetching and under-fetching of data.

Modern development scenarios needing flexible, efficient data retrieval


Interview Tips:

Emphasize that all three approaches use the same underlying LDS cache

Show understanding of when each approach is most appropriate

Mention that base components are fastest for simple forms

Explain wire adapters provide the most flexibility

Note that GraphQL is newest and most efficient for complex data needs

Demonstrate knowledge that these can be combined in the same component

Don't forget to mention they all respect the same security and sharing rules
