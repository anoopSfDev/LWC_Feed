Answer:
There are two approaches for communication between unrelated Lightning Web Components on the same page:

1. Lightning Message Service (LMS) – Recommended

LMS is use to communicate between components in a single Lightning page or across multiple pages

It works between Lightning web components, Aura components, and Visualforce pages in any tab or in any pop-out window in Lightning Experience.

It also works across namespaces.


⚠️ Limitations:

LMS does not work in:

Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce sites

Visualforce pages in Experience Builder sites


2. pubsub Module – Legacy Option

The pubsub module is a custom JavaScript-based publish-subscribe pattern, primarily used in environments where LMS isn’t supported (e.g., legacy apps)

⚠️ Limitations:

Not officially supported or maintained by Salesforce.
