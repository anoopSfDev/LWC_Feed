Lightning Message Service (LMS) is Salesforce's modern, official communication framework that enables publish-subscribe communication between Visualforce pages, Aura components, and Lightning Web Components within Lightning Experience.

Key Differences:

| Aspect                 | Lightning Message Service (LMS)                                     | PubSub Module                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Support Status**      | Officially supported by Salesforce                                 | **Not officially supported or maintained**         |
| **Scope**               | Works across navigation tabs, utility bars, pop-out windows        | Restricted to single page only                     |
| **Framework Support**   | Works with LWC, Aura, and Visualforce                              | Primarily designed for LWC                         |
| **Implementation**      | Built-in Salesforce feature                                        | External module from GitHub                        |
| **Metadata**            | Uses LightningMessageChannel metadata                              | No metadata required                               |
| **Cleanup**             | Automatic cleanup on component destroy                             | Manual unregistration required                     |
| **Namespace Support**   | Works across namespaces                                            | Limited namespace support                          |
| **Security**            | Secure by default with namespace isolation                         | Basic security                                     |



Interview Tips:

Always emphasize that LMS is the official, supported solution

Mention that PubSub is deprecated and not maintained

Explain LMS works across different Lightning Experience areas, not just same page

Show understanding that LMS requires metadata setup but provides better security

Demonstrate knowledge that LMS supports cross-framework communication (LWC ↔ Aura ↔ Visualforce)

Don't recommend PubSub unless specifically asked about legacy scenarios
